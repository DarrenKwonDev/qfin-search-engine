  "abstract": "We study the interaction between returns and order flow imbalances in the S&P 500 E-mini futures market using a structural VAR model identified through heteroskedasticity. The model is estimated at one-second frequency for each 15-minute interval, capturing both intraday variation and endogeneity due to time aggregation. We find that macroeconomic news announcements sharply reshape price-flow dynamics: price impact rises, flow impact declines, return volatility spikes, and flow volatility falls. Pooling across days, both price and flow impacts are significant at the one-second horizon, with estimates broadly consistent with stylized limit-order-book predictions. Impulse responses indicate that shocks dissipate almost entirely within a second. Structural parameters and volatilities also exhibit pronounced intraday variation tied to liquidity, trading intensity, and spreads. These results provide new evidence on high-frequency price formation and liquidity, highlighting the role of public information and order submission in shaping market quality.",
